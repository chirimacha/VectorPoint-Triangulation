# VectorPoint-Triangulation
Public repository for VectorPoint App with triangulation feature.
Codes and Supplementary data for "Incentivizing Multiple Objectives in Active Surveillance for Urban Disease Vectors"

# User's Instructions 
The new functionality of the VectorPoint App draws lines between inspected houses and divides the uninspected spaces into triangles. Every time a new house is inspected, the house became a vertex in a set of Delaunay triangles. New triangles will be formed in the app in real-time and will be immediately visible to you, allowing you to see your spatial coverage, seeing the number of uninspected houses in the largest triangle as the metric with which we evaluated spatial coverage.

In the next link "..........." you can try the app.
